# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

An end-to-end machine learning project using the Kaggle Titanic dataset. The aim is to predict passenger survival based on personal information such as age, sex, class and fare.

Built in Python with Jupyter Notebook, demonstrating applied data science skills including exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, machine learning and evaluation.

## Features
- Exploratory data analysis, including summary statistics and visualisations of survival trends.
- Data preprocessing by handling missing values, converting categorical features and calculated new features.
    - Trained a linear regression model to predict missing ages.
- Trained a Random Forest classifier to predict survival with an 80%/20% train/test split.
- Achieved 82.7% accuracy with strong precision, recall and F1 score.
- Analysed feature importance - identifying sex, age and fare as the strong indicators.
- Generated a prediction CSV file with test set for Kaggle submission.

## Tech Stack
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook

* Scikit-learn

## What I Learned
Working on this project has helped me strengthen skills that are directly applicable in a practiacal data science and machine leaning setting. These skills include:
#### Data Wrangling & Preprocessing
* Cleaning data, resolving missing values, transforming categorical features and building new features.
### Exploratory Data Analysis
* Using visualisations and statistis to uncover insights and patterns.
#### Machine Learning
* Training, validating and evaluating machine learning models (Linear Regression and Random Forest).
#### Model Interpretation
* Analysing feature importance to explain key influences of predictions.
#### Reproducible Workflows
* Building a clear, end-to-end pipeline from raw data to actionable predictions.
* Clearly documented using a Jupyter Notebook.
